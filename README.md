## My experince

This is my first web app using react and css flexbox. Think to be able to know how I have to write the code by myself
It was difficult, although very educational. The hardest part was the design and responsiveness since I had never done css myself.

I liked doing the logic and I learned how to write the code in different ways
and used tools that had not used.

Making this website cost me but I liked the final result although it needs improvements.
